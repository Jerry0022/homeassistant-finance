"""Stable account identity across bank re-links.

Enable Banking issues a fresh account uid for every PSU session.  Treating
that uid as the account's identity meant a re-link of the same bank created
a second set of entities for the same real account, and left the previous
ones orphaned in the registry.

The identity of a payment account is its **IBAN**.  This module derives a
stable, non-identifying key from it and merges account records around that
key, so re-linking a bank updates the existing accounts instead of adding
copies.

The key is a truncated SHA-256 digest rather than the IBAN itself: it lands
in HA's entity registry and in entity settings UI, and the security model
forbids putting account numbers anywhere they are not strictly needed.

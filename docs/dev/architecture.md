## Config flow

1. `user`: Enable Banking application id + RSA private key, validated live.
2. Banks are added as **config subentries** (`BankSubentryFlow`, `connect.py`): ASPSP choice, PSU
   redirect through `my.home-assistant.io`, code exchange, test call, account assignment
   (personal vs. shared).
3. Reconfigure flow (credentials) and options flow (daily refresh, `show_household`, retention, ...).

## Refresh and rate limit (per bank)

`fetch_budget.py` holds the budget per bank (ASPSP), never global:
- Background calls (no PSU headers) are counted per account per UTC day; the scheduled daily
  refresh may use at most `SCHEDULED_BACKGROUND_SHARE` of the limit.
- Attended calls (PSU headers from a real request) are uncapped, never gated on a block, only
  debounced (`ATTENDED_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`).
- A 429 blocks that bank's background access for `RATE_LIMIT_BACKOFF_HOURS` (6h); other banks are
  unaffected. State is persisted across restarts.

Flow: "Neu importieren" button / service -> `POST /api/finance_dashboard/refresh` ->
`manager.async_refresh_transactions()` (lock-guarded) -> balances + transactions per bank in one
round -> stats written to cache -> coordinator pushes to entities -> endpoint returns
`{ok, status}`. Cache-read endpoints (`/balances`, `/transactions`, `/summary`, `/refresh_status`)
never hit the bank.

### Fetch triggers

Imports are rate limited, so page views and re-processing must never cost a call. The server
enforces this; the frontend is not trusted to behave.

| Trigger | Calls the bank? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| "Neu importieren" (`POST /refresh` with body `{"trigger": "user_import"}`, admin) | yes, attended | A POST without that body is rejected with HTTP 400 `explicit_trigger_required` before any client is built |
| `refresh_transactions` / `refresh_accounts` service, refresh button entity | yes | Explicit user/automation action; no PSU IP -> background, capped |
| Setup bootstrap (config flow, setup wizard) | yes, attended | Part of connecting a bank |
| Scheduled daily refresh (`daily_refresh_*`) | yes, background | Exactly one per day |
| Panel open, page views, every HTTP GET | never | Cache reads only |
| "Aktualisieren" (`POST /reprocess`, `reprocess_data` service) | never | Replays stored raw data |
| Coordinator refresh / entity updates | never | Cache reads only |

`refresh_status` still carries `auto_refresh_on_open` (always `false`) and
`auto_refresh_max_age_seconds` (always `0`) for older frontends; the options were removed.
`tests/test_fetch_triggers.py` pins this, including an AST check that only the known trigger
modules reference the live-fetch methods.

## Storage

`data_store.py`: every store is HA `Store` with a Fernet-encrypted payload (key from the credential
manager), versioned with a migrate hook.
- **Raw layer**: every bank response unaltered, immutable snapshots, one store per month. Kept
  forever by default (option `raw_retention_days`, 0 = lifelong). Each snapshot carries replay
  metadata (`account_key`, `fetch_id`, `date_from`); a `transactions_window` snapshot closes a fetch
  with its `truncated` flag.
- **Ledger layer**: processed, deduplicated per-account transactions and balance time series,
  lifelong (no pruning, no cap). Categories, summaries and splits are derived, never stored here.
  A fetch is evidence only for the span the bank reported: a bank that answers a long request
  with less history never erases older ledger entries.
- **Reprocessing** (`reprocess.py`): `PROCESSING_VERSION` (const) versions the raw → ledger
  processing. Bump it with every change to normalisation, ingest or transaction identity. On
  start, a ledger written by another version is rebuilt by replaying the raw archive through the
  live code path (no bank call); the old ledger is saved to `…_ledger_backup_v<old>` first, history
  the archive does not cover is carried over, and an unreadable archive aborts the rebuild.
  Service `reprocess_data` forces it.
- **History backfill**: the first attended fetch of an account per bank session requests
  `HISTORY_BACKFILL_DAYS` (3650 → 730 → 365 → 90, stepping down on HTTP 400/422). Background fetches
  never backfill (each rejected window would spend the 4/day cap). Later fetches are incremental.

## Entities and devices

One device per bank and per account (`entity.py`). Per account: balance, available balance,
last-update sensors (`sensor.py`). Per bank: consent valid-until, consent state, budget used,
blocked-until, last error, plus a refresh button (`button.py`). Aggregates: total balance, monthly
summary. Balance history is imported as long-term statistics (`balance_statistics.py`).
`diagnostics.py` redacts financial data. See `entities-and-services.md`.

## Frontend

One kit (`finance-dashboard-kit.js`, `fd-*` components), see `docs/ARCHITECTURE-FRONTEND.md`.
- Sidebar panel via `panel_custom`, admin-only (`panel.py`).
- Cards auto-loaded through `frontend.add_extra_js_url`, no manual resource entry.
- Panel tabs: facts **Overview**, and **Household** (only when option `show_household` is on).

## Distribution

HACS only (`hacs.json`). There is no companion add-on and no payload sync.

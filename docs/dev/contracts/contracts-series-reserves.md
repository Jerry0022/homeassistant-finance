# Contracts, series, reserves, pot coverage (Phase 4d) - handoff

Modules: `recurring.py` (`detect_series`), `contracts.py`, `pots.py` (`pot_coverage`, `Pot.account_key`), `api/contracts.py`.
Everything is cache-only; no bank call is added.

## Series (`recurring.detect_series(transactions, today=, amount_tolerance=0.20, date_tolerance_days=5, overrides=)`)
Intervals: weekly (>=4 payments), monthly, quarterly, half_yearly, yearly (>=2). Amounts in bank sign.
One price step is allowed (a series with two +-tolerance jumps is rejected). Fields: `id` (stable hash of payee+direction),
`interval`, `next_expected`, `expected_amount`/`plan_amount`, `plan_mode` (highest default / average / last / median / fixed),
`annual_cost`, `status` (`active` / `missing` > date tolerance overdue / `ended` > 2 periods overdue),
`price_change {previous,last,change_pct,increase,date}`, `category`, `account_key`, `account_type`, `account_person`.
`detect_recurring` (monthly, home screen) is unchanged. `recurring.add_months` is a public helper.

## Contract model (`contracts.Contract`, stored in `.storage/finance_dashboard_contracts`)
Fields (all optional, `null` = prefilled default): `start`, `min_term_months`, `renewal_months`, `notice_value`,
`notice_unit` (days/weeks/months), `notice_reference` (`end_of_term`/`end_of_month`), `owner`, `category`,
`plan_position_id`, `special_termination` (null = derive), `plan_mode`, `plan_fixed_amount`.
Category defaults: insurance 12/12 + 3 months; telecom 24/12 + 1 month; subscriptions 1/1 + 0; utilities/loans/housing 12/12 + 1/3/3 months; else 1/1 + 0.
Start falls back to the first seen payment. Deadline = (term end, or month end of it) - notice; rolls to the next renewal if passed.
Special termination prefill: last 3 payments, traits amount / booking day / gap; >=2 traits differing -> unchecked, else checked.
`special_termination_available` = latest price change is an increase and the (stored or prefilled) flag is checked.

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/finance_dashboard/contracts` - expense series + `contract` block + `next_deadline`, `effective_end`, `days_until_deadline`,
  `notice_due_soon`, `special_termination_available`, `monthly_equivalent`; sorted by next deadline. Admin full; non-admin only
  shared/own, reduced to aggregates (`aggregate_view`: no payment history).
- `PUT /api/finance_dashboard/contracts/{series_id}` (admin) partial edit; 400 `{error,detail}` on invalid, 404 `unknown_series`. Returns the updated contract.
- `GET /api/finance_dashboard/reserves` - `{reserves:{items,by_owner,total_monthly}, coverage}`; coverage is admin-only (`null` for others).
- `PUT /api/finance_dashboard/accounts/{key}/savings` `{savings: bool}` (admin) - sets `savings` on the account record via `async_set_accounts`; kept across `async_refresh_accounts`.

## Reserves and coverage
Reserve = every quarterly/half-yearly/yearly expense series (not `ended`): `annual_cost / 12`, grouped by owner.
Coverage: `Pot.account_key` (new optional field) names the account a `reserve`-kind pot sits on; per account
virtual total (pot `cycle_budget`) vs real balance (`pick_balance`) -> `covered` / `shortfall` (+`top_up`) / `unknown` (no cached balance).
Pots without `account_key` are counted in `unassigned_pots`. The pots endpoint may expose `account_key` via `Pot.to_dict`.

## Notice event hook for the setup agent
`await contracts.async_fire_notice_due(hass, get_effective_transactions(manager._transactions))` - call from the daily
refresh path after the ledger update. Fires `finance_dashboard_notice_due` (`series_id, creditor, deadline, effective_end, days_left, owner`; no amount)
for deadlines 0..30 days away, once per contract per deadline (markers persisted in the contract store). Returns the count.

## Open
- Views are registered in `api/__init__.py`; the hook call is NOT wired into the refresh path yet.
- No frontend; no strings/translations added (API returns codes only).
- Plan position link is stored only; no plan-vs-actual use yet.
